    "content": "Consumers have a lot of doubts about buying electric cars, compared to fuel cars. Wang Chao pointed out that among the factors affecting the purchase of electric vehicles, charging problems account for 80 percent, with a small number of charging piles (currently, the ratio of piles is 3.2:1) and a long charging time being the first to bear the brunt. As a result, many players in the charging infrastructure sector are looking for a break. To alleviate consumers' pain points of poor charging experience, we need to improve the pile ratio and shorten the charging time to meet consumers' requirements for fast charging."

Huawei works with partners to integrate 5G, cloud, AI, intelligent edge, and industry applications to form an integrated intelligent system and create industry-leading smart experience. In the transportation industry, the abolition of highway toll stations at the provincial boundary enables fast and insensitive traffic, greatly improving traffic efficiency and reducing logistics transportation costs. Intelligent cameras are deployed on highway portals to collect vehicle traffic data 24 hours a day and send the data to the cloud in real time over the high-speed network for real-time charging. In addition, AI models trained on the cloud can be pushed to the edge so that cameras can have capabilities such as license plate recognition and vehicle feature extraction, and the capabilities can be continuously evolved. For example, in extreme weather conditions such as rain and snow, one-click upgrade can be performed on the cloud."
